# MicroMouse 24-25 (IEEE@UCI)
By Adam Wu and Jeremiah Yong
## Project Summary
A robot(mouse) that navigates a 16x16 cell maze, from corner to center using an STM32F103C8T6(bluepill) microcontroller

**Concepts Utilized:** Floodfill, PWM, Proportional-Integral-Derivative(PID) Correction

**Tools Utilized:** KiCad, STM32CubeIDE, C/C++, soldering, Neovim
## Folder Contents
- Firmware: Code for IR Sensors, motors, encoders, PID, and translation of simulation code to real-world navigation
- Hardware: Kicad layouts and schematics
- Software: Floodfill algorithm, mouse navigation in simulation, and testing
